If you need help during this lesson, look at the official Bootstrap documentation site.

To recap, Bootstrap is a CSS framework for responsive development. It provides a variety of pre-created classes that you can use in your HTML if you choose to include the framework in your project. If you find yourself needing to create complicated functionality that is pretty standard in the web development world (such as progress bars, accordians, or modals), Bootstrap can be a valuable resource.

**Part 1:**
To start, edit 'index.html' so that you can use Bootstrap classes in the file.


**Part 2:**
Next, use Bootstrap to create an accordian with four accordian items.

**Part 3:**
Use Bootstrap to create a modal that appears or disappears whenever a button is pressed. Your modal should be titled 'My first modal!!' and its body text should say 'Welcome to this modal.' Then, use your own CSS in 'style.css' to override the background-color of your button to make it pink. 

**Part 4:** 
Use bootstrap to create a green spinning loading icon.
